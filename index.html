		    <h1>Our idea :</h1>
		    <p>Our idea is to create a Label, with artists who don't take themselves seriously yet, the idea is to find an identity for them and to offer cheap studio sessions because it remains a hobby for our consumers.




		    </p>
		
		    <h2>How to choose?</h2>
		    <p>Choosing our Label means not locking yourself into contracts and remaining independent. The team of enthusiasts helps you out of pure pleasure, hence the attractive price. Artists complain about a lack of freedom today among labels and record companies, so it's a new means of creation.

		   	<h3>Why call on us?</h3>
		   	<p>To call us is to choose simplicity, freedom and not to lock oneself in this profession of artist which is sometimes hard to assume financially. The artist is free, takes the advice he wants, and works on it when he wants. Our teams are there to meet the needs of artists and not the other way around.
